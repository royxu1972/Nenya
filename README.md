# Combination Design

Combination Design provides some algorithms for combinatorial testing.

## generation

Generate a covering array with as few test cases as possible.

* AETG

## prioritization

Reordering existing test suite to maximize combination coverage or minimize switching cost.

* Combination coverage based prioritization

* Switching cost based prioritization

	* Greedy Algorithm (basic and enhanced)
	* Dynamic Programming (optimal)
	* Genetic Algorithm
	* `LKH.exe` Solver for TSP (only in Windows)

* Multi Objective Optimization

	* Hybrid Based Greedy Algorithm
