# Combination Design

Combination Design provides some algorithms for combinatorial testing.

## generation

Generate a covering array with as few test cases as possible.

* AETG

## prioritization

Reordering existing test suite to maximize combination coverage or minimize switching cost.

* Combination coverage based prioritization

* Switching cost based prioritization
	* Greedy Algorithm
	* Dynamic Programming (optimal)
	* Genetic Algorithm
	* LKH Solver for TSP (Windows only)

* Multi Objective Optimization
	* Hybrid Based Greedy Algorithm
